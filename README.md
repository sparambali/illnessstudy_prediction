I am using three machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression, support vector machine and decision tree to predict whether tumor is malignant or it is Benign
Present the Confusion Matrix and Classification Report for each of the three (3) algorithms (i.e. SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees).
Finally comparing all these models and choosing the best one
